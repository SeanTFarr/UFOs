# UFO sightings: Are we alone?

## Overview of Project

Dana, a data journalist, was given an exciting opportunity to do a report about her hometown, which is well known for UFO sightings. While working on this report, she came across a dataset of UFO encounters. She asked for my help to display UFO the data in a table on a webpage. She not only wanted to see the data, but also wanted the user to be able to filter the data to drill down to specific occurences. 

#### Resources used:
- JavaScript-data file and app.js file to build the table and run functions
- HTML to display the webpage
- Bootstrap to organize the webpage
- CSS to customize the webpage(dark form element)
